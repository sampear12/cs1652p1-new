# CS 1652: Project 1

## Overview

In this project, your group will build a simple web client and a succession of
servers to which it can connect. The goal is to slowly introduce you to Unix
and socket programming and prepare you for project 2 (where you’ll be
implementing a TCP layer that your web client/servers can run on top of). There
is also an extra credit server you can build that has a basic structure similar
to real web servers that need to handle many connections.

## HTTP and HTML 

The combination of HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext
Markup Language) forms the basis for the World Wide Web. HTTP provides a
standard way for a client to request typed content from a server, and for a
server to return such data to the client. "Typed content" simply means a bunch
of bytes annotated with information (a MIME type) that tells us how we should
interpret them. For example, the MIME type text/plain tells us that the bytes
are unadorned ASCII text. You will implement a greatly simplified version of
HTTP 1.0. 

HTML (type text/html) content provides a standard way to encode structured text
that can contain pointers to other typed content. A web browser parses an HTML
page, fetches all the content it refers to, and then renders the page and the
additional embedded content appropriately. 

## HTTP Example 

In this project, you will implement a subset of HTTP 1.0. HTTP was originally a
very simple, but very inefficient protocol. As a result of fixing its
efficiency problems, modern HTTP is considerably more complicated. The
specification of HTTP 1.1 in RFC 2616 is over a hundred pages long!
Fortunately, for the purposes of this project, we can ignore most of the
specification and only implement a small subset.

The HTTP protocol works on top of TCP, a reliable stream-oriented transport
protocol, and is based on human-readable messages. Because of this, we can use
the telnet program to investigate how HTTP works. We'll use telnet in the role
of the client and <www.washington.edu> in the role of the server. (why University
of Washington? well, there just aren't that many unencrypted HTTP websites
around anymore...) The typed content we;ll transfer is University of
Washington's home page. This is essentially the same as fetching the home page
using your favorite web browser. 

The following shows what this looks like for the URL
<http://www.washington.edu/>. The text wrapped in asterisks (\*\*like this\*\*)
is what you would type, and the rest is an example output from when I ran this
on December 30, 2024.

---

The first thing to notice is that we are opening a TCP connection to port 80.
Telnet does a DNS lookup on the host www.washington.edu and finds that it is at
IP address 34.82.219.4 (note you may get a different IP address when you try
this – can you think of why that might happen?). It then opens the connection
and lets us type.

`GET / HTTP/1.0` is the most basic form of an HTTP 1.0 request, and the form
that you will implement. It says "please give me the file (`GET`) that
corresponds to the top-level page (`/`) using the 1.0 version of the HTTP
protocol (`HTTP/1.0`)." The blank line demarcates the end of the request. This is
necessary because a more complex request may place further conditions (on
additional lines) on what the client is willing to accept and how it is willing
to accept it.

The response always begins with a line that states the version of the protocol
that the server speaks (`HTTP/1.1` in this case), a return/status/error code
(`200`), and a textual description of what that error code means (`OK`). Next,
the server provides some information about the content it is about the send as
well as information about itself and what kinds of services it can provide. The
most critical line is `Content-Type: text/html`, which tells us how to
interpret the content we receive. A blank line demarcates the end of the
response header and the beginning of the actual content. After the content has
been sent, the server closes the connection.

## Part 0: Install and configure your Linux environment 

We will be using an Ubuntu 24.04 VM to provide a consistent testing
environment. You need to make sure your submission works with the provided VM.

Please follow the instructions in Canvas to install VMware Fusion and load the
course VM. The username and password for the VM are both `cs1652`.

Note: while rare, in certain cases, bugs may manifest differently depending on
the underlying hardware architecture being used. In your submission, please
include a README that states what architecture you tested your project on (e.g.
ARM vs x86).

## Part 1: HTTP Client

Write a client program that supports the following command line syntax and semantics. 

    ./http_client <server_name> <server_port> <server_path>

When run, `http_client` should open a connection to port `server_port` on the
machine `server_name`, and then send an HTTP request for the content at
`server_path`. It should then read the HTTP response the server provides. If the
response is that `server_path` is valid and includes the data, `http_client` should
write the data out to **standard out** and exit with a **return code of zero**. You can
then view this output using a web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Edge). If
there is an error, `http_client` should write the response to **standard error** and
exit with a **return code of -1**. For example:

    ./http_client www.washington.edu 80 /index.html

should print the University of Washington home page to standard out and return zero, while:

    ./http_client www.washington.edu 80 junk.html

should print the response to standard error and return -1.

# Part 2: Connection-at-a-time HTTP Server 

Write an HTTP server that handles one connection at a time and that serves
files in the current directory. This is the simplest kind of server. The
command-line interface will be:

    ./http_server1 <port>

You will then be able to use `http_client`, `telnet`, or any web browser, to
fetch files from your server. For example, if you run:

     ./http_client <host> <port> http_server1.c

you should receive the contents of your source file. 

Note that you will not be able to run your server on port 80. Ports less than
1500 are reserved, and you need special permissions to bind to them.

Your server should have the following structure: 

1. Create a TCP socket to listen for new connections on (What packet family and type should you use?) 

2. Bind that socket to the port provided on the command line. We’ll call this socket the accept socket. 

3. Listen on the accept socket (What will happen if you use a small backlog
   versus a larger backlog? What if you set the backlog to zero?) 

4. Do the following repeatedly:

    a. Accept a new connection on the accept socket (When does accept return?
       Is your process consuming cycles while it is in accept?) Accept will
       return a new socket for the connection. We’ll call this new socket the
       connection socket. (What is the 5-tuple describing the connection?)

    b. Read the HTTP request from the connection socket and parse it. (How do
       you know how many bytes to read?) 

    c. Check to see if the file requested exists.

    d. If the file exists, construct the appropriate HTTP response (What’s the
       right number?), write it to the connection socket, and then open the
       file and write its contents to the connection socket.

    e. If the file doesn’t exist, construct a HTTP error response and write it
       back to the connection socket

    f. Close the connection socket.

# Part 3: Simple Select-based Multiple-connection-at-a-time Server 

The server you wrote for part 2 can handle only one connection at a time. Try
the following. Open a telnet connection to your `http_server1` and type nothing.
Now make a request to your server using your `http_client` program. What happens?
If the connection request is refused, try increasing the backlog you specified
for listen in `http_server1` and then try again. After `http_server1` accepts a
connection, it blocks (stalls) while reading the request and so is unable to
accept another connection. Connection requests that arrive during this time are
either queued, if the listen queue (whose size you specified using listen) is
not full, or refused, if it is. Consider what happens if the current connection
is very slow. Your server is spending most of its time idle waiting for this
slow connection while other connection requests are being queued or refused.
Note that reading the request is only one place where `http_server1` can block:
it can also block on waiting for a new connection, on reading data from a file,
and on writing that data to the socket. 

Write an HTTP server, `http_server2`, that avoids just two of these situations:
(1) waiting for a connection to be established, and (2) waiting on the read
after a connection has been established. 

You can make the following assumptions: 

* If you can read one byte from the socket without blocking, you can read the
  whole request without blocking. 
* Reads on the file will never block 
* Writes will never block

It is important to note that if you have no open connections and there are no
pending connections, then you **should** block (i.e. your program should not
consume processing cycles or "busy-wait" in this case).

To support multiple connections at a time in `http_server2`, you will need to
do two things:

* Explicitly maintain the state of each open connection 
* Block on multiple sockets, file descriptors, events, etc.

It is up to you to decide what the contents of the state of a connection are
and how you will maintain them. However, Unix, as well as most other operating
systems, provides a mechanism for waiting on multiple events. The Unix
mechanism is the `select` system call. `select` allows us to wait for one or
more file descriptors (a socket is a kind of file descriptor) to become
available for reading (so that at least one byte can be read without blocking),
writing (so that at least one byte can be written without blocking), or to have
an exceptional condition happen (so that the error can be handled). In
addition, `select` can also wait for a certain amount of time to pass. 

Your server should have the following structure: 

1. Create a TCP socket to listen for new connections on 
2. Bind that socket to the port provided on the command line. 
3. Listen on that socket, which we will call the accept socket. 
4. Initialize the list of open connections to empty 
5. Do the following repeatedly:
    a. Make a list of the sockets we are waiting to read from the list of open
       connections. We shall call this the read list. 

    b. Add the accept socket to the read list. Having a new connection arrive
       on this socket makes it available for reading, it’s just that we use a
       strange kind of read, the accept call, to do the read. 

    c. Call select with the read list. Your program will now block until one of
       the sockets on the read list is ready to be read. 

    d. For each socket on the read list that select has marked readable, do the
       following: 

        i. If it is the accept socket, accept the new connection and add it to
           the list of open connections with the appropriate state 

        ii. If it some other socket, perform steps 4.b through 4.f from the
            description of http_server1. After closing the socket, delete it from
            the list of open connections. 

Test your server using telnet and `http_client` as described above.

# Extra Credit: Complex Select-based Multiple-connection-at-a-time Server 

`http_server2` can handle multiple connections at a time, but there remain a
number of places where it can block. These are implicit in the assumptions we
have made. In general, almost any system call can block. In particular, if
`select` tells us that a file descriptor is readable, it only means that at least
one byte can be read. Reading any subsequent byte may block. The same holds
true for writes. 

To avoid unnecessary blocking, then, the program must check each system call
that may block, and certainly read and write, before it executes the system
call. Does this mean that we have to call select before we read or write each
byte? Not necessarily. We can instead use non-blocking I/O. If we set a file
descriptor to operate in non-blocking mode, then system calls on that file
descriptor will fail with an `EAGAIN` error instead of blocking. `EAGAIN` means
"I can't do that right now because doing so would block you and you asked me
never to let that happen." To read more about non-blocking I/O, see the man
page for `fcntl`. `fcntl(fd,F_SETFL,O_NONBLOCK)` is one way to set a file
descriptor to non-blocking I/O. To learn how to retrieve error codes from
system calls, check out the man page for `errno`.

For extra credit, you can build an HTTP server, `http_server3`, that uses
`select` and non-blocking I/O to provide availability even in the face of
blocking on any of the reads, writes, and accepts, as well as dealing with
partial reads and writes. The overall structure of the code is as follows:

1. Create a TCP socket to listen for new connections on 
2. Bind that socket to the port provided on the command line. 
3. Listen on that socket, which we will call the accept socket. 
4. Initialize the list of open connections to empty. You should associate with
   each connection its state, the file descriptor for the file it is reading,
   and any other information you need.
5. Do the following repeatedly:

    a. Make a list of file descriptors we are waiting to read from the list of
       open connections. This will include both sockets and file descriptors for
       files you are in the process of reading. We shall call this the read list. 

    b. Add the accept socket to the read list. 

    c. Make a list of sockets we are waiting to write from the list of open
       connections. We shall call this the write list. 

    d. Call select with the read list and the write list. Your program will now
       block until one of the sockets on the read list is ready to be read or
       written. 

    e. For each socket on the read list that select has marked readable do the following:

        i. If it is the accept socket, accept the new connection, set its
           socket to be non-blocking, and add it to the list of open connections
           with the appropriate state 

        ii. If it's some other socket, look up its connection in the list of
            open connections, figure out how much you have left to read, and then
            read until you get an `EAGAIN` or you’ve read the whole request.

            1. If you get `EAGAIN`, update the connection’s state accordingly.
            2. If you've read the whole request, open the file, set its file
               descriptor to non-blocking, add it to the connection state, and
               update the state to note that you’re in the process of reading
               the file. 

        iii. If it's some other file descriptor, look up its connection in the
             list of open connections, figure out how much you have left to read,
             and then read until you get an `EAGAIN` or you've read the whole file.

             1. If you get `EAGAIN`, update the connection state to reflect you
                much you have read. 
             2. If you've read the whole file, close the file, update the
                connection state to reflect that you are ready to start writing
                the contents to the socket. 

    f. For each socket on the write list that select has marked writeable do the following:

        i. Look up its connection in the list of open connections, figure out
           how much you have left to write, and then write until you get an EAGAIN
           or you’ve read the whole request. 

            1. If you get `EAGAIN`, update the connection state to reflect how
               much you’ve written. 
            2. If you've written the whole file, close the socket and remove
               the connection from the list of open connections. 

## Logistics

* You should work in teams of exactly two students

* You are encouraged to use version control to collaborate with your partner on
  the same codebase. Using Github for this purpose is encouraged, but your
  repositories must be PRIVATE and shared only with your partner

* Your code must be written in C and must compile with the default version of
  gcc provided in the course VM. We will expect that running `make` will
  generate the executables `http_client`, `http_server1`, `http_server2`, and
  (if you decide to do the extra credit), `http_server3` according to our
  Makefile. 

* You will submit everything needed to build and run your project in a single
  zip file. This includes: `http_client.c`, `http_server1.c`, `http_server2.c`
  and (if you do it) `http_server3.c`. It also includes the Makefile (even if
  you do not modify it), and README stating your test environment hardware. 

* Assignments will be submitted in Canvas
